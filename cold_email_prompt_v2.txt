Goal:
Generate a concise, semi-formal cold email to a university student or recent intern asking to learn more about their experience at a specific company (e.g., Amazon, NVIDIA, etc.).
The tone should sound genuine, curious, and personable — not corporate or transactional — and should match my writing style (modeled after my Math 54 email).

------------------------------------------------------------
Tone & Style Guidelines:
- Concise, semi-formal, and personal (student-to-student tone).
- No corporate fluff (“I would be honored,” “I’m passionate about…”).
- Avoid generic admiration; every sentence must add value or connection.
- Respectful and warm, but direct and confident.
- Anti-Fluff Rule: remove or avoid any paragraph that simply praises the company
  in a general way. Replace it with a specific connection between my work and
  the recipient’s experience.

------------------------------------------------------------
Output Format:
Write the final email as if it will be sent via Gmail.

1. Start with a **Subject line**, formatted exactly like:
   Subject: [concise, natural subject line]
   (Example: "Subject: Quick chat about your experience at Amazon")

2. Leave one blank line after the subject, then write the full email:
   - Greeting
   - Body (introduction → connection → bullet-point background → closing)
   - Sign-off

3. Do NOT include outlines, placeholders, or section headers.
4. Keep total email length between 120–220 words.

------------------------------------------------------------
Core Email Structure:

Subject:
- One concise line summarizing purpose (e.g., “Quick chat about your experience at [Company]”)

Greeting:
- "Dear [First Name],"

Introduction & Purpose:
- Introduce me: “My name is Rohin Sood, and I’m a freshman studying EECS at UC Berkeley.”
- Mention how I came across their profile (e.g., LinkedIn, project, or team).
- State interest in learning about their experience as a [Position] at [Company].

Connection:
- Relate their role, team, or company focus (from provided keywords/context) to my own projects and studies.
- Keep this specific and conversational.

About Me (Bulleted Section):
Include 3–4 short bullets drawn from my background:
• EECS student at UC Berkeley (Class of 2029)
• Conducting AI/ML research at NASA Ames (predictive modeling for spaceflight biology)
• Built an AI tutoring assistant Chrome extension using NLP and Google Meet API
• Created a machine learning slap-bass transcription tool for automatic audio-to-notation
• Former Blockchain Developer at San Diego Supercomputer Center and FRC Engineering Director

Location Note (Optional):
If relevant, add later in the email (not upfront):
“Also noticed you’re based in San Diego — I’m originally from there too, so it’s always nice to see others from back home in tech.”

Closing & Availability:
- Ask if they’d be open to a brief informal chat about their experience.
- Add my availability:
  “I’m generally free from 3:30–6:30 PM PST and after 8:00 PM on most weekdays, but happy to adjust.”
- End with a short, polite thank-you.
