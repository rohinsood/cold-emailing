I’m currently exploring how AI and machine learning can enhance customer experience in e-commerce platforms, especially around content recommendation and supply chain logistics. Your role at Amazon, with its focus on scalable infrastructure and AI-powered services, seems closely connected to some of the projects I’m working on.

A bit about me:
• EECS student at UC Berkeley (Class of 2029)  
• Conducting AI/ML research at NASA Ames on predictive modeling for spaceflight biology  
• Built an AI tutoring assistant Chrome extension using NLP and Google Meet API  
• Developed a machine learning tool for automatic slap-bass transcription  
• Former Blockchain Developer at San Diego Supercomputer Center and FRC Engineering Director  

Also noticed you’re based in San Diego — I’m originally from there too, so it’s always great to see others from back home in tech.
